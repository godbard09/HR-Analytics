# Project Overview
The HR Analytics Dashboard is an interactive data visualization project aimed at analyzing employee attrition to support strategic HR decision-making. Using Power BI, the dashboard presents key metrics and insights to help identify patterns and risk factors associated with employee turnover.

# Key Highlights
* Analyzed employee attrition by education field, age group, salary range, job role, education field, and years at the company.

* Identified high-risk groups, such as employees aged 26–35, those earning below $5,000/month, and those with less than 2 years of tenure.

* Compared attrition across different job roles – Sales Executives and Laboratory Technicians showed the highest turnover.

* Created clear visualizations (bar, pie, line charts) for better understanding and engagement.

# Outcomes
* Enabled HR teams and managers to take data-driven actions to improve employee retention.

* Supported the development of more targeted onboarding, compensation, and engagement strategies.
